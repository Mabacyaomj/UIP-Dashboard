This script is a database dump generated by phpMyAdmin for a MySQL or MariaDB database. A dump includes both the structure of the database (tables, columns, etc.) and the data it contains. Here's a step-by-step explanation of each section of the script:

Header Comments

-- Host: 127.0.0.1: Indicates that the dump was created from a local server.
Database Settings
SQL Mode:

SET SQL_MODE = "NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO";: Allows the AUTO_INCREMENT columns to start from 0 if needed.
Transaction Handling:

START TRANSACTION;: Begins a database transaction to group all operations in the script.
COMMIT;: Finalizes and applies all changes made in the transaction.
Timezone and Character Set:

SET time_zone = "+00:00";: Ensures operations are time-zone consistent.
/*!40101 SET NAMES utf8mb4 */;: Sets the character encoding for the session to utf8mb4 to handle a wide range of characters, including emojis.

Auto-Increment
ALTER TABLE 'preboarding_attendance' MODIFY 'app_id' int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=8149;:
Sets the app_id column to automatically increment.
The next value starts at 8149.
Restoring Settings
